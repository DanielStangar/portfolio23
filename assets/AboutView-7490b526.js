I was 54, it wasn&#39;t easy, but also not super difficult. My ability to study literally anything that I had built up as a translator helped me a lot. Ten month later my son was born and in spite of all the happiness and hard work it involves, I have kept studying and practicing coding, while keeping also my taxi business as the main income source. </p><p class="modal" data-v-4a9e3bc8> The real test of any type of knowledge knowledge is practice. So I kept building websites and applications and was able to see the results of my work straight away. Experienced coders heavily recommended this approach too. The further I progressed, the more more problems I was able to solve. Apart from other works I have done, three of my websites are live and work for actual businesses. </p><p class="modal" data-v-4a9e3bc8> Nowadays it seems that my results in front end development and connecting it to a database are satisfactory. I can build workable website from scratch or do modifications and improvements of some existing website. </p><p class="modal" data-v-4a9e3bc8> At this stage, some king of trial seems to me best way forward. Therefore I am looking for a form of apprenticeship, or working part time for just a symbolical reward. I am happy to do some smaller tasks at first to see if I am able to help effectively. That I can do from home. My life is organized in such a way that I can deliver about 15-20 hours per week. </p><p class="modal" data-v-4a9e3bc8> Please, take a look at my portfolio and see for yourself whether you like my work. </p>',8),K=[J],O={__name:"AboutText",setup(a){return(s,o)=>(c(),l("div",G,K))}},Q=n(O,[["__scopeId","data-v-4a9e3bc8"]]),d=a=>(f("data-v-d9811b84"),a=a(),h(),a),U={class:"about"},X={class:"left-side"},Y=d(()=>e("section",{class:"download"},[e("h3",null," For recruiters and HR managers "),e("a",{href:"CVdownload.html"},"Download my CV")],-1)),Z=d(()=>e("h3",null," My coding certificates ",-1)),ee=d(()=>e("h3",null," Briefly about myself ",-1)),ae={class:"right-side"},te={__name:"AboutView",setup(a){y();let s=_(!0),o=_(!1);function g(){console.log("openAboutMe"),s.value=!0,o.value=!1}function w(){console.log("openCerts"),o.value=!0,s.value=!1}return(se,oe)=>(c(),l("div",U,[t(r,{name:"page",appear:""},{default:i(()=>[t(k)]),_:1}),t(I),t(r,{name:"page",appear:""},{default:i(()=>[e("main",null,[e("div",X,[t(L),Y,e("section",{class:"certificates"},[Z,e("button",{onClick:w},"Display Certificates")]),e("section",{class:"texts"},[ee,e("button",{onClick:g}," Read More")])]),e("div",ae,[t(r,{name:"fade"},{default:i(()=>[p(t(Q,null,null,512),[[m,u(s)]])]),_:1}),t(r,{name:"fade"},{default:i(()=>[p(t(P,null,null,512),[[m,u(o)]])]),_:1})])])]),_:1})]))}},ne=n(te,[["__scopeId","data-v-d9811b84"]]);export{ne as default};
