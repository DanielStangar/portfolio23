const Alpha18Title = 'Small Taxi Business'

const Alpha18Text = 'This is the first website I have made and it promotes my own enterprising. Probably the most important aspect is that it serves its purpose. I am not able to say how many phone calls are made directly from the website, but for sure I  get every month several email requests for taxi without spending any money for advertising.'
const Alpha18Text2 = "TECHNICAL: The website is just HTML and CSS. Its buttons make phone calls, send text messages and emails. The contact page sends emails too. There is also a short book available for download as a gift for customers."

const flowerClubTitle = 'Local Club of Flower Arrangers'

const flowerClubText = 'I have made this website free of charge for Lingfield Flower Club, which is a bunch of very skilled flower arrangers. The club managers were happy that the website worked out more elegant and attractive than websites of clubs in neighbouring areas.'

const flowerClubText2 = 'TECHNICAL: The website has animations that were first done in vanilla Javascript. Later I have rebuilt the website in Vue JS3, with composition API, Pinia and Firestore database, which added administrative back door to be able to edit and create adverts.'

const plannerTitle ='Planner for Forgetful Managers'

const plannerText ='This web app is seemingly simple to-do list, but it gives prompts to help user remember to note down tasks that might otherwise be forgotten. It is meant for everybody and it really works.'
const plannerText2 = 'TECHNICAL: This was my exercise of basic Javascript and I used a local storage to save users data.'

const CavCarsTitle = 'Another Taxi Company'
const CavCarsText = 'My colleague liked my first website so much that he wanted a copy of it for himself. Eventually I did it only partially, using the color and style of his business card as a basis. Later I made for this website a backdoor administrative entrance to enable the owner to modify his price list. That is quite practical in time of inflation and ever-changing fuel prices.'
const CavCarsText2 = 'TECHNICAL:The first version was just HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. The second version I built using Vue JS3 and Firebase Firestore database to have a backend for editing the price list. There is also an authentication for the database entry.'

const adMakerTitle="Advert Maker"
const adMakerText="This is actually a simple Content Management System tailor made for the flower club website. It allows club managers to make new adverts, delete the outdated ones and edit as needed. Because the managers of the club are mostly retired ladies in their 70s, I have included also an interactive instruction manual to make it easier for them to work with it."
const adMakerText2 = "TECHNICAL: This is made in Vue JS3, Composition API with the use of Vue Router, Pinia, Vite and Firebase Firestore database and its authentication facility."

const portfolioTitle = "This Portfolio Website"

const portfolioText2 = "TECHNICAL: This website is made in Vue JS3, Composition API with the use of Vue Router and Vite."
